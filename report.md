ASSIGN to variables: c_type1, c_type2
INPUT numb1 as c_type1[key]
MATCH c_type1, c_type2 to key in dictionary
IF c_type1 != Pound Sterling and c_type2 != Pound Sterling:
    CONVERT c_type1 into Pound Sterling
    CONVERT Pound Sterling into c_type2
    RETURN int of c_type2
ELSE:
    IDENTIFY Pound Sterling as c_type1 or c_type2
    CHANGE this value to or from Pound Sterling
